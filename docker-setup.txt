# Requirements:
# Have docker installed in the local machine
# Have docker-compose installed in the local machine
# Download kafka-docker to local
git clone https://github.com/wurstmeister/kafka-docker.git

# Go to the folder
cd kafka-docker/

# Edit the docker-compose.yml file with the file in this repository.

# After editing the docker-compose.yml, launch the Kafka-docker
docker-compose up -d

# To check if kafka is initialized:
docker-compose logs kafka | grep started

# Other way to check if kafka is initialized is using Kafka GUI Tool
# To download the tool go to: https://www.kafkatool.com/download.html

# Once we have kafka on, we can use it as if we had it installed in our machine
# and we can use the same producer.py and consumer.py from this repository.
# To use this producer and consumer we have to change the ports in the files
# In this case, we have to change localhost:9092 to localhost:29092 in both 
# producer.py and consumer.py
# Once we've updated the files, we can just run the scripts:
# Produce into KafkaDocker
python3 producer.py 
# Consume from KafkaDocker
python3 consumer.py

# Next step is to use producer and consumer as docker images.
